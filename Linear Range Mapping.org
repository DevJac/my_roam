#+title: Linear Range Mapping
* Linear Range Mapping
If we have a range from A to B, and we want to map that range onto another range, C to D, in a linear fashion we can use the following formula:

y = ((x - A) / (B - A)) * (D - C) + C

Remember that B - A can be viewed as a vector from A to B.

The ((x - A) / (B - A)) term gives us the proportion that x is through the range A to B. We then multiply that proportion by the range C to D, and move the result to the appropriate place with + C.
