** NVIDIA drivers
I had trouble with NVIDIA drivers after upgrading to Fedora 42 (Apr 2025).

The important commands to install NVIDIA drivers are:

First, install RPMFusion Nonfree.

Then:

~sudo dnf reinstall akmod-nvidia kmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda~

and then maybe

~sudo akmods --force --rebuild~

if the first command doesn't work.
