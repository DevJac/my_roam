#+title: Racket
A programming language.
* Learning Resources
** Official Guide
[[https://docs.racket-lang.org][The official docs]] and especially [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/][the official guide]] appear to be the best starting points for me to learn the Racket language.
* Install
** MacOS
To install racket and racket-mode requirements from the shell:
#+begin_src shell
  brew install racket
  raco pkg install --auto drracket
#+end_src
To run DrRacket, start the racket REPL with =racket= and then enter =(require drracket)=.
* racket-mode Tips
** errortrace
Run code using the =racket-run-with-errortrace= command to enable tracebacks in error messages.
