#+title: Exponents and Logarithms
* Different notation is confusing, use exp(x) instead
An exponent and a logarithm are inverse operations, but they have completely different notation.

Exponents are written $$ e^x $$, but logarithms are written using function notation $$ \ln(x) $$.

I could use a different notation like $$ \exp_b(x) $$ for exponents. This is less confusing to me.
* Logarithm rules
** Power rule
$$ \log(x^n) = n \log(x) $$
*** Proof
\begin{align*}
y &= \ln(x) \\
\exp(y) &= \exp(\ln(x))    && \text{$\exp$ both sides, $\exp(x) = e^x$} \\
e^y &= x                   && \text{back to normal exponential notation} \\
e^{(yn)}&= x^n             && \text{raise both sides to $n$} \\
\exp(yn) &= x^n            && \text{back to exp notation} \\
\ln(\exp(yn)) &= \ln(x^n)  && \text{$\ln$ both sides} \\
yn &= \ln(x^n) \\
ln(x)\ n &= ln(x^n)        && \text{done, remember $y = \ln(x)$ from above}
\end{align*}
