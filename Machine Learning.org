#+title: Machine Learning
* Resources
** Notebooks from University of Amsterdam's Deep Learning MSc Course
https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Tutorial 6 covers transformers.
** Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces
https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396

A sequence modelling architecture I want to research. It appears to be closer to an RNN than a Transformer.
** Transformer Pseudocode
