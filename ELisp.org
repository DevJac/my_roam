#+title: Elisp
* Conventions
** Comments
Elisp comments start with one or more semicolons (~;~).
*** Inline comments: ~;~
Inline comments should use a single semicolon ~;~.

Such comments are often vertically aligned to the right:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq base-version-list                 ; There was a base
      (assoc (substring fn 0 start-vn)  ; version to which
             file-version-assoc-list))  ; this looks like
                                        ; a subversion.
#+end_src
*** Full line comments: ~;;~
Comments that use a full line should start with two semicolons ~;;~.

These comments should come before the code they are commenting about and should be aligned on the left with the code.
*** Section headings: ~;;;~
Section headings use three semicolons ~;;;~ and should be left-most aligned.

Outline mode can be used to cycle the visibility of these sections.
