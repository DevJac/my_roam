#+title: Rust
* Rust
** Basics
*** Values
A value is bits and a type. You must know the type to know how to interpret the bits.

A value must be stored in a place. A value's meaning is independent of where it is stored.
**** Places we can store values
***** Stack / variable
A variable is a named memory location on the stack.
***** Heap / pointer
A pointer's value is a heap address that holds another value.
***** Static memory
Static memory contains the compiled binary code and static values (declared with the static keyword).

The static lifetime does not necessarily mean something is stored in static memory. The static lifetime means a value will live as long as static memory is around, that is, until the end of the program.
*** Ownership
/Values/ are owned. The owner is responsible for deallocating the value. This usually happens automatically when the owner goes out of scope, unless you manually drop the value earlier.
**** Taking ownership of a mutable reference
You can take ownership of a mutable reference, but you must put a valid value back in its place.

Use the following functions to do this:
- ~std::mem::replace~
- ~std::mem::take~
- ~std::mem::swap~
**** Interior mutability
Some types provide interior mutability, meaning they allow you to mutate a value through a shared reference.
***** Types that produce mutable references from shared references
- ~RefCell~
- ~Mutex~
***** Types that have methods to mutate in place through a shared reference
- ~Cell~
- Atomic integer types in ~std::sync::atomic~
** Special Traits
*** Copy
The Copy trait changes how moving ownership works. Copy values do not move; their ownership does not move.
** Unsafe
Unsafe functions inform the caller they must maintain certain invariants. A caller who marks a portion of their code as unsafe is promising to maintain those invariants. Unsafe is used for invariants that cannot be maintained by the compiler.

Unsafe code allows you to dereference raw pointers, and call unsafe functions, that's it.
* Code Examples
** EventBus
*** Code
