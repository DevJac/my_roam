#+title: Model-View-Controller Design Pattern
A design pattern for software. Also known as "MVC".
* Model
A data structure (not code) that represents the state of the program.
* View
Code that renders the state of the program (the model).

More generally, the view might also perform timed-based actions based on the state. For example, rendering might involve drawing a GUI every frame, a time based action.
* Controller
Code that handles events from the world, such a mouse clicks or web requests. The controller updates the model.

In some formulations of MVC the controller sits between the model and view, thus decoupling the model and view.
