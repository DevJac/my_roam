#+title: Self Improvement Thoughts
* Second guessing conversations
Sometimes after a conversation I will second guess myself. Did I talk to much? Did I explain that thing well enough, or was I confusing? Stuff like that.

Here's a trick to dismiss such thoughts from your mind: Ask yourself "was I acting like myself?" If so, that is good enough, and there is no need to spend energy second guessing yourself.
* Play fun games
Play games that are fun to play. Merely interacting with the game and watching it unfold should be fun, win or lose.

Do not play a game solely for the sake of improving (or achievements), there are more rewarding things to improve at than a game.

Do not play a game to become better than others.

If a game causes frustration, rage, or tilt then you are not playing for fun. If you play a fun game, for fun, then you cannot fail to get the desired outcome (fun) and will not be frustrated.
